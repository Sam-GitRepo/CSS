## Flex Container Properties

- ### flex-direction
  - Specifies the direction of the **flexible items** inside a flex container
- ### flex-wrap
  - Specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not, if there is not enough room for them on one flex line
- ### flex-flow
  - A shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap
- ### justify-content
  - Horizontally aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis
- ### align-items
  - Vertically aligns the flex items when the items do not use all available space on the cross-axis
- ### align-content
  - Modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines

## flex-direction

The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.

### Flex direction can be of ":

- column
- column-reverse
- row
- row-reverse

# CSS Flex Items

The direct child elements of a flex container automatically becomes flexible (flex) items.

## The flex item properties are:

- ### order
  - Specifies the order of the flex items inside the same container
- ### flex-grow
  - Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same container
- ### flex-shrink
  - Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same container
- ### flex-basis
  - Specifies the initial length of a flex item
- ### flex
  - A shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and the flex-basis properties
- ### align-self
  - Specifies the alignment for a flex item (overrides the flex container's align-items property)

## The order Property

The order property specifies the order of the flex items.

- The first flex item in the code does not have to appear as the first item in the layout.

- The order value must be a number, default value is 0.

- order is a comparision between each child and according to that positioned.

## Flex Grow

The flex-grow property specifies how much a flex item will grow **relative** to the rest of the flex items.

- The value must be a number, default value is 0.

```
 if total width is 100 and we have 3 item
 item-1 flex-2
 item-2 flex-4
 item-3 dlex-2

 then width of item-1 (2 * 100)/8 = 25%
 then width of item-2 (4 * 100)/8 = 50%
 then width of item-3 (2 * 100)/8 = 25%
```

## flex-shrink

The flex-shrink property specifies how much a flex item will shrink **relative** to the rest of the flex items.

The value must be a number, default value is 1.

- if flex-shrink = 0 then the item will not shrink.

## flex-basis

The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of a flex item.

- if length is not change later then it will be of the flex-basis size always.

## flex

The flex property is a shorthand property for the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties.

## align-self

The align-self property specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container.

The align-self property overrides the default alignment set by the container's align-items property.
